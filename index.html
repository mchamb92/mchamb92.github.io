<h1> Why are you studying Software Engineering?</h1>   
<h2> 
    I am enrolled in the 2020 Software Enginering cohort program at Flatiron School because it is my last hope.
    I received a Bachelor's degree in Health Administration back in 2017, but I find solace in writing code, data structures and algorithms.
    My Flatiron journey will end with me having a full stack tech stack.
